# Mad Men Mondays: Introduction

The very first episode of Mad Men opens with the title card:

> "Mad Men: A term coined in the late 1950's to describe the advertising executives of Madison Avenue. They coined it."

And this --- before the opening episode even starts --- is the first of many many lessons to be drawn from this popular US TV series about an advertising agency in the 1960's: Always take control of your brand message.

For them it was that they were a new breed: the Creatives.

They weren't like any other office-worker America had seen. They rocked up to work late, drank all day, hit the bars at night, and generally worked their expense accounts hard. The work they did was undefinable, but the results had the clients coming back for more.

The talent mattered, the client relationship mattered, and the results mattered. They became famous, admired and wealthy.

But really? Am I saying we can learn about how to run agencies from a TV show? Yes, I really am.

After that opening title card, our very first sight of Don Draper is him working at a table in a bar, sketching out ideas on a napkin, and asking a waiter for his input. He doesn't have to be in an office during office hours to be getting his ideas. He gets ideas from wherever he can, whenever he can.

And we all should too. So, set Monday evenings aside to watch an episode each week with us (perhaps with an Old Fashioned to hand if that's your thing). We'll post up a new article about an episode each week, you can watch it, and we can all learn something and get some new ideas together. Plus, it'll be fun --- I promise.

A few words on scope in advance. Mad Men is full of the smoking, excessive drinking, racism, sexism and probably a few other unsavoury elements that were more prevalent in those times. Not at all in line with our 'Healthy' approach. Don't try those things at home kids. So, that's not the focus of this blog series. Instead, we'll be looking for genuine ideas and insights that you can use to run a healthy agency.
